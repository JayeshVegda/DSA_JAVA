# Step-By-Step Breakdown

1. The hello method is called from the main method with an initial value of n = 5. </br>
2. Inside the hello method:
    * It checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, it returns, effectively ending the recursion.</br>
    * If n is not equal to 0, it prints "Hello World" to the console.</br>
    * Then, it calls itself recursively with n - 1.</br>
    * Let's visualize the call stack as each recursive call happens:
</br>
</br>
# Call Stake

| Call Stack                 | Execution                         |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| hello(5)                   | n = 5                             |
| hello(4)                   | n = 4                             |
| hello(3)                   | n = 3                             |
| hello(2)                   | n = 2                             |
| hello(1)                   | n = 1                             |
| hello(0)                   | n = 0, returns                    |
</br>
As hello(0) returns immediately without printing anything, the recursion ends.</br>
The call stack then starts unwinding:</br>
* hello(0) returns to hello(1)
* hello(1) returns to hello(2)
* hello(2) returns to hello(3)
* hello(3) returns to hello(4)
* hello(4) returns to hello(5) 

Once the initial call to hello(5) returns, the program execution completes.
